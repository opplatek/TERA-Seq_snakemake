- fetch params.org from the main Snakemake
    - make aliases for assembly (hg3x = Homo sapiens, ...) and use that instead of hardcoding
- specificy assembly (hg38, ...) in config file for each sample separately
- find a proper way how to use lambda in rule gtrna_download as output (fetch gtrna_bed from get_links)
- make params visible in output for minimap2 indexing (k12) so we can specify all output files properly
- test STAR indexing and alignment; as of 03/22/2023 untested
- consider switching from params: tmpdir in STAR indexing to output: temp(tmpdir), maybe with touch to a *deleteme* file inside the tempdir[]
- set params: k for minimap2 indexing from the map_minimap2.smk so Snakemake fetches it automatically
- in all ribosomal_map, change samtools -m {params.mem_mb} relative to some portion of max allowed memory
- move links to download references per reference from references-prep.smk to a config file
- fetch main output dir for samples from config and change the rules to SAMPLES_DIR + ...
- fetch data dir from config DATA_DIR + ...
- unify naming of the rules
- think about how to 'force' sqldb to not run at the same time other than 'xxx.done' files
- add nanopolish to the Docker/Singularity
- add nanopolish to Snakemake rules if fast5 directory is specified in the config file
- fetch 5tera, 5tera-short, tera3, 5tera3 library type from config and choose correct adapter trimming and sqldb annotation
- figure out how to access input: params: ... from the parent rule if we use use rule .. as ..: so we can only change what we need
- Note: It seems that if we use use rule .. as .. and we change just a single setting from let's say input: we have to se all the other ones as well - it would be easier if the use as rules inherit everything but the changed variables
