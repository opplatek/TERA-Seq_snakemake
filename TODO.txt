- make params visible in output for minimap2 indexing (k12) so we can specify all output files properly
- test STAR indexing and alignment; as of 03/22/2023 untested
- consider switching from params: tmpdir in STAR indexing to output: temp(tmpdir), maybe with touch to a *deleteme* file inside the tempdir[]
- set params: k for minimap2 indexing from the map_minimap2.smk as {k} so Snakemake fetches it automatically
- in all ribosomal_map, change samtools -m {params.mem_mb} relative to some portion of max allowed memory
- move links to download references per reference from references-prep.smk to a config file
- fetch main output dir for samples from config and change the rules to SAMPLES_DIR + ...
- fetch data dir from config DATA_DIR + ...
- unify naming of the rules
- think about how to 'force' sqldb to not run at the same time other than 'xxx.done' files
- add nanopolish to the Docker/Singularity
- add nanopolish to Snakemake rules if fast5 directory is specified in the config file
- figure out how to access input: params: ... from the parent rule if we use use rule .. as ..: so we can only change what we need
- Note: It seems that if we use use rule .. as .. and we change just a single setting from let's say input: we have to se all the other ones as well - it would be easier if the use as rules inherit everything but the changed variables
- add TERA3 preprocessing, alignment, annotation
- add 5TERA3 preprocessing (two adapters!), alignment, annotation
- add mouse tests
- add yeast annotation (add UTRs, convert naming, fix annotation, ...)
- add yeast tests
- make conditional use of rules for TERA3/5TERA3 preprocessing and annotation; alignment is the same except using polya/total library 
    - the easiest is probably to make a wrapper and decide there with if condition (make it in Python)
    - other solution to make it conditional is to make list of desired output files and add/remove based on the condition; however, it wouldn't work here because the condtion is sample dependent
- make conditional references for polya vs total libraries (protocol in config/samples.csv)
