A Snakemake workflow for `<description>`


## Usage

The usage of this workflow is described in the [Snakemake Workflow Catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/?usage=<owner>%2F<repo>).

If you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits to the authors by citing the URL of this (original) <repo>sitory and its DOI (see above).

# TODO

* Replace `<owner>` and `<repo>` everywhere in the template (also under .github/workflows) with the correct `<repo>` name and owning user or organization.
* Replace `<name>` with the workflow name (can be the same as `<repo>`).
* Replace `<description>` with a description of what the workflow does.
* The workflow will occur in the snakemake-workflow-catalog once it has been made public. Then the link under "Usage" will point to the usage instructions if `<owner>` and `<repo>` were correctly set.# Singularity and Snakemake

## Notes
* Nice summary [here](https://siscourses.ethz.ch/container_pipeline_tutorial/2_container_pipeline_tutorial.pdf)
* Another decent summary [here](https://wfbroderick.com/2022-Aug-01.html) and [here](https://snakemake-on-nesi.sschmeier.com/singularity.html)
* General simple Docker build info [here](https://devopscube.com/build-docker-image/)

## *Inside* vs *outside* 
* Running Singularity has two "main" options
    1) Bind the data into the Singularity container and run the whole analysis inside - less flexibility but more reproducibility (cannot use host-installed software)
    2) Specify to run Singularity in each Snakemake rule and collect the results - more flexibility but less reproducibility (needs Python, Snakemake, ..., installed on the host)

## (?) Our solution
* Install Python3, Conda (Miniconda), and Snakemake (inside Conda) on the host and only run the individual steps in the Singularity container
    * We'll hope most of the hosts have Python3 installed and Miniconda doesn't need root access
* Or pre-make Singularity container like [here](https://snakemake-on-nesi.sschmeier.com/singularity.html) and run the whole workflow with `snakemake --use-singularity`
    
## Install environment
cd /home/jan/projects/TERA-Seq_snakemake/
mamba env create -f environment.yaml -n snakemake
conda activate snakemake    

### Make singularity image
singularity pull docker://joppelt/teraseq

    
## TODO
* How to run different Conda environments within the Singularity?
    * I like to pre-generate all Conda envs Snakemake workflow needs - can this be done in Singularity? I guess you would have to activate Conda on host, and then have pre-made Conda envs in the container and activate them in (?) Snakemake rule wrappers
* Cut Dockerfile to the bare minimum (if it works)
* If the *old* Dockerfile doesn't work, make a new one

### Make Singularity from Docker
```
#docker build -t local/my_container:latest .
sudo docker build -t local/teraseq:conda .
#sudo singularity build my_container.sif docker-daemon://local/my_container:latest
sudo singularity build teraseq-conda.sif docker-daemon://local/teraseq:conda
'''

* run Singularity in an interactive mode
`singularity shell container.sif``

## Notes
* `docker run -ti my_image /bin/bash`
