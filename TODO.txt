-move "scripts" into real scripts, could be bash, with sourcing the perl/conda inside the sh scripts (or python with from snakemake.shell import shell)

- write documentation!
- finish tera3 preprocessing (we only have adapter trimming, but nothing else)
- cut Dockerfile to complete minimum only necessary for the Snakemake+Singularity run
- Note: Snakemake cannot handle having two rules outputing the same output file name. It makes sense, this is how it's designed. But it makes it incompatible with sqldb databases
- test whole run of full fastq.gz
- test STAR indexing and alignment; as of 03/22/2023 untested
- consider switching from params: tmpdir in STAR indexing to output: temp(tmpdir), maybe with touch to a *deleteme* file inside the tempdir[]
- set params: k for minimap2 indexing from the map_minimap2.smk as {k} so Snakemake fetches it automatically
- in all ribosomal_map, change samtools -m {params.mem_mb} relative to some portion of max allowed memory relative to threads
- move links to download references per reference from references-prep.smk to a config file
- fetch main output dir for samples from config and change the rules to SAMPLES_DIR + ...
- fetch data dir from config DATA_DIR + ...
- unify naming of the rules
- think about how to 'force' sqldb to not run at the same time other than 'xxx.done' files
- add nanopolish to Snakemake rules if fast5 directory is specified in the config file
- figure out how to access input: params: ... from the parent rule if we use use rule .. as ..: so we can only change what we need
- Note: It seems that if we use use rule .. as .. and we change just a single setting from let's say input: we have to se all the other ones as well - it would be easier if the use as rules inherit everything but the changed variables
- add TERA3 preprocessing, alignment, annotation
- add 5TERA3 preprocessing (two adapters!), alignment, annotation
- make conditional use of rules for TERA3/5TERA3 preprocessing and annotation; alignment is the same except using polya/total library
    - the easiest is probably to make a wrapper and decide there with if condition (make it in Python)
    - other solution to make it conditional is to make list of desired output files and add/remove based on the condition; however, it wouldn't work here because the condtion is sample dependent
- make conditional references for polya vs total libraries (protocol in config/samples.csv) other than just 5tera, tera3, or 5tera3 (~"force" polya/total annotation)
- make selection of trimming/assignment based on output (rel5 vs rel3) in the input of the last rule and not sort of hardcoded like we have it now
    - right now, it somehow works for 5tera and tera3, but would fail for 5tera3
- switch the input functions to unpack() https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#input-functions-and-unpack


- For Fadia
    here's the corresponding figure numbers (in blue) for the analyses, no pressure please, the most important analysis is the ribothrypsis profile (point 1-2) this will at least give me an idea if chasing the treatment/KD/Kout is promising or not:

    changes in ribothrypsis profile (5TERA- 5' ends of RPFs) under different treatments, and in KD, Kout of specific proteins. we will need public data for RPF comparison; you do have the RPFs of humans and yeast and I can lookup and share the SRA for differentiated mouse neurons. [Figure 6B, 5P-polyA; top]
     The prevalence of ribothrypsis in mouse neurons. [Figure 6B, 5P-polyA; top]
    Average read density distribution of molecule ends across annotated transcripts for each species. [Figure 1D, 5P-polyA]
    Check if decay profile of genes with long exons varies compared to ones with short exons. New
    Distrubution of 5' ends on specific transcripts with visualization of coverage and alignment of sequenced molecules. [Figure 2C]
    The relatioship of 5'TERA and polyA tail length. [Figure 4B, 4C right plot]
    Enrichment of G-quads downstream of cuts specially in mouse and yeast KD/kout. [this was done in ribothrypsis paper Figure 5A]
    Relation of 5â€² ends of native RNA molecules to transcription start sites and to active promoters. [Figure 2D]
