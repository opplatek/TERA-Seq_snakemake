A Snakemake workflow for `<description>`


## Usage

The usage of this workflow is described in the [Snakemake Workflow Catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/?usage=<owner>%2F<repo>).

If you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits to the authors by citing the URL of this (original) <repo>sitory and its DOI (see above).

# TODO

* Replace `<owner>` and `<repo>` everywhere in the template (also under .github/workflows) with the correct `<repo>` name and owning user or organization.
* Replace `<name>` with the workflow name (can be the same as `<repo>`).
* Replace `<description>` with a description of what the workflow does.
* The workflow will occur in the snakemake-workflow-catalog once it has been made public. Then the link under "Usage" will point to the usage instructions if `<owner>` and `<repo>` were correctly set.# Singularity and Snakemake

## Notes
* Nice summary [here](https://siscourses.ethz.ch/container_pipeline_tutorial/2_container_pipeline_tutorial.pdf)
* Another decent summary [here](https://wfbroderick.com/2022-Aug-01.html) and [here](https://snakemake-on-nesi.sschmeier.com/singularity.html)

## Pipeline

### Prepare dependencies

#### *Inside* vs *outside* 
* Running Singularity has two "main" options
    1) Bind the data into the Singularity container and run the whole analysis inside - less flexibility but more reproducibility (cannot use host-installed software)
    2) Specify to run Singularity in each Snakemake rule and collect the results - more flexibility but less reproducibility (needs Python, Snakemake, ..., installed on the host)

#### (?) Our solution
* Install Python3, Conda (Miniconda), and Snakemake (inside Conda) on the host and only run the individual steps in the Singularity container
    * We'll hope most of the hosts have Python3 installed and Miniconda doesn't need root access
* Or use pre-make Singularity container like [here](https://snakemake-on-nesi.sschmeier.com/singularity.html) instead of Conda installation
    
#### Install Conda environment
* Install Conda and basic Conda environment. 

* I recommend to use [**miniconda**](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). If you don't have **miniconda** (or **conda**) on your system, follow the instructions in the link. 

* When installed, you can prepare the basic conda environment:
```
git clone https://github.com/opplatek/TERA-Seq_snakemake
cd TERA-Seq_snakemake/
conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
mamba env create -f environment.yaml -n tera-snakemake # If you don't have mamba, replace it with conda
```
or from *scratch*:
```
mamba env create -n tera-snakemake \
    -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c anaconda -c r \
    python=3.7.1 snakemake-minimal=7.24.0 pandas pygments jinja2 networkx pygraphviz # If you don't have mamba, replace it with conda
```

`pygments jinja2 networkx pygraphviz` are not essential and are only use for reports (can be skipped)

Note: To update to new *version* of TERA-Seq Snakemake, you can go:
```
cd TERA-Seq_snakemake/
git fetch
```
This will download new and updated file and will keep your own files (compared to `git pull` which would delete your local files.

#### Install Singularity
**Important:** Installing Singularity in Conda doesn't work well. The system doesn't see it as a root installation and converts all Singularity containers (.sif) into a sandbox for **every** Snakemake output.

First, check whether you have all the dependencies from [here](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html#install-dependencies) and have [Go installed](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html#install-go)

For Ubuntu 20.04 and the tested version, do:
```
cd ~/tools/
wget https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/download/v3.11.1/singularity-ce_3.11.1-bionic_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./singularity-ce_3.11.1-bionic_amd64.deb && rm singularity-ce_3.11.1-bionic_amd64.deb
singularity version
```

### Pull Singularity image from Docker hub
In case you didn't install all the dependencies, you wiil definitely need to install `squashfs-tool` to build Singularity image from Docker hub.
```
# Export tmp and cache dir to avoid extensive writing into /root directory
tmpdir=$(pwd)/tmp
mkdir $tmpdir
export SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=$tmpdir
export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=$tmpdir

singularity pull docker://joppelt/teraseq:snakemake # If you have Singularity # If you have Singularity 2 (tested on 2.6.1-dist); will make teraseq-snakemake.simg
singularity pull teraseq-snakemake.sif docker://joppelt/teraseq:snakemake # If you have Singularity 2 (tested on singularity-ce version 3.11.1-bionic)
```

### Run the pipeline
**Important:** If you have Singularity 2.x.x (tested on 2.6.1), change ##### Define container ##### in Snakefile to Singularity 2 version (`singularity: "teraseq-snakemake.simg"`)
```
conda activate tera-snakemake
snakemake --use-singularity -c1 -p --configfile config/config-test.yaml
```
  
## TODO
* How to run different Conda environments within the Singularity?
    * I like to pre-generate all Conda envs Snakemake workflow needs - can this be done in Singularity? I guess you would have to activate Conda on host, and then have pre-made Conda envs in the container and activate them in (?) Snakemake rule wrappers
